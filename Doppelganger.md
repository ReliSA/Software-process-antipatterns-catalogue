# Doppelganger

**Also Known As:**

n/a


## Summary

Doppelganger is an anti-pattern in which a person—typically a manager or a peer—exhibits two markedly different and alternating behaviors. At times the individual is cooperative, supportive, and easy to work with; at other times the same person becomes hostile, unreasonable, or aggressive. These unpredictable switches create confusion, mistrust, and communication breakdowns within the team, ultimately affecting collaboration and performance.


## Symptoms

-	Inconsistent tone and attitude in communication.
-	Sudden and unexpected shifts between cooperative and hostile behavior.
-	Two distinct communication patterns exhibited by the same individual.
-	Team members feel uncertain about how interactions will unfold.
-	Increased misunderstandings and miscommunication.
