# Empire Building

**Also Known As:**

n/a


## Summary

Empire Building is an anti-pattern in which managers compete with each other by recruiting or “stealing” promising talent from other teams to strengthen their own influence, visibility, or control. Rather than improving overall organizational performance, this behavior fragments knowledge, disrupts team cohesion, and prioritizes managerial power over project or organizational goals.


## Symptoms

-	Frequent movement of skilled team members between teams or projects.
-	Declines in quality, productivity, or communication despite talent concentration.
-	Loss of continuity and domain knowledge within affected teams.
-	Increased competition and tension between managers.
-	Projects suffer delays due to repeated team restructuring.
-	Team morale deteriorates as individuals are treated as resources rather than contributors.
