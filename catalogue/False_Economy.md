# False Economy

**Also Known As:** n/a


## Summary

Expensive development (or similar) staff being slowed down by the inadequacies of their infrastructure - both technical and organisational - and wasting time jumping through institutional hoops to, say, get a network connection working because the support system is lame and inefficient.

## Symptoms

 - noticeable number of formal requests (tickets) filed by developers to have infrastructure set up or corrected, or to make a management decision over an issue
 - such requests take long (perhaps several days or more) to get resolved
 - there is excessive discussion associated with such requests

## Specific To
