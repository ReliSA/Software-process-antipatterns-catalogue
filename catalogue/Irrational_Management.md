# Irrational Management

## Also Known As

n/a

## Summary

Irrational Management is an anti-pattern in which a manager or management team is unable to make consistent and rational decisions. This behavior may stem from personality traits, lack of confidence, or an obsessive focus on details. When confronted with problems or crises, decisions tend to be reactive and impulsive rather than strategic or well-considered. These knee-jerk reactions cause the project to thrash, amplifying instability and generating additional problems instead of resolving existing ones.

## Context

## Unbalanced Forces
