# Irrational Management

**Also Known As:** n/a


## Summary

The manager (or management team) of one or more development projects is unable to make decisions, due to a personality defect or the result of an obsession with details.  When faced with a crisis, the manager's decisions are knee-jerk reactions rather than carefully thought-out strategies or tactical actions. These reactions cause the project to thrash and to further problems.
