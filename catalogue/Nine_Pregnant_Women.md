# Nine Pregnant Women
**Also Known As:** Size Isnâ€™t Everything
## Summary
An idea that adding more resources (developers) to the project will increase productivity, pace or quality has the opposite effect. As opposed to [Brooks' Law](Brooks_Law.md), the concern is not an overdue project, but slower pace and drop in productivity and quality in general. Therefore failure to meet mid-project milestones, release criteria, etc. The name is derived from the colloquial expression "nine women can't make a baby in one month".
## Symptoms
 - adding new people mid-project, esp. as a release deadline draws close
 - the overall productivity stays the same or drops, while productivity per capita drops (at least for some time)
 - higher bug rate per developer, lower feature delivered rate per developer, higher duplicate ratio
 - higher communication overhead due to new people getting acquainted with the project
 - underdelivering or overdue releases, milestones postponed
