# Vietnam War

## Also Known As

n/a

## Summary

It’s a metaphor that refers to a project that has already failed.

## Context

To understand this anti-pattern, it helps to briefly recall the Vietnam War. For the United States, it became a costly failure: vast amounts of money were spent and many human lives were lost, with no meaningful success. Today, the term is used metaphorically to describe a project that has already failed and should not receive further investment of time, money, or effort.

## Symptoms and Consequences

-	It makes the organization spend more money and time on a project that hasn’t success.
-	Burnout of the employees.
-	The reputation of the organization decreases from a public view.

## Causes

-	The organization already has spent a lot of money and time.
-	An unsuccessful project that didn’t finish the way it was expected.

## Solution

-	Define middle objectives that should be reached during the project, if they aren’t, it’s an end line to the project.
-	Seek validation from someone who isn’t working on the project. They will not react with emotions like the ones who are working on it.


## Notes

This anti-pattern is very similar to “Escalation of Commitment” that’s why they have the similar sources. There are two documents because the explanation of one isn’t the explanation of the other.
