# Brownie's Works

## Also Known As

n/a

## Summary

Junior members actively write and commit code but their code is changed completely, and without a prior discussion, by a senior team member before it gets to the customer. The motivation of junior members deteriorates. The anti-pattern is a side effect of Collective Ownership together with a failure of the senior member to e.g. use pair programming when changing (refactoring) the junior member's code. The root cause is the senior's lack of sense of team building.

## Context

## Unbalanced Forces

## Symptoms and Consequences

 - junior developer (a person relatively new to the project) commits code
 - the code is then rewritten and committed by a senior developer, the rewrite goes into a release
 - the senior's change relates to the same ticket
 - no sign of pair programming or discussion of code changes prior to senior member's commit(s)
