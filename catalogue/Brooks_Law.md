# Brooks' Law
**Also Known As:** Adding People to a Late Project Makes it Later, Size Isn’t Everything
## Summary
Project becomes late (overdue) due to following the idea that adding more resources (developers) to the project will increase productivity, pace or quality.
## Symptoms
 - new people added mid-project, esp. when progress becomes lagging behind plan
 - since that moment: the overall productivity stays the same or drops, productivity per capita always drops
 - and/or: higher bug rate per developer, lower feature rate per developer, higher duplicate ratio
 - and/or: more ticket comments, email messages per capita (signs of higher communication overhead due to new people getting acquainted with and communicating during the project)
 - failure to meet the project delivery date, possibly also interim deadlines
