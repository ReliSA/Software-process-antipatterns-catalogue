# Confusion Of Objectives

## Also Known As

n/a

## Summary

Confusion of Objectives is an anti-pattern in which a manager is unable to focus consistently on the shared objectives of the team or project. Attention is diverted to personal goals, political concerns, career-related interests, or external pressures. As a result, critical managerial decisions are delayed or avoided, leaving the team without direction and causing essential tasks to stall while team members remain unaware of the underlying issues.

## Context

## Unbalanced Forces

## Symptoms and Consequences

-	The manager spends significant time on activities unrelated to the project’s goals.
-	Key managerial decisions are postponed or not made at all.
-	Team members are blocked waiting for approvals or prioritization.
-	Project objectives become unclear or appear to shift unpredictably.
-	Progress slows due to lack of guidance and alignment.
