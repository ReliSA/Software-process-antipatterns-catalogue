# Escalation of Commitment

## Also Known As

n/a

## Summary

It’s when the organization is persistent in a project that has no future.

## Context

The error is seen as something that can be correct with money and time, but in the end it cannot. Once the organization can’t see the reality the commitment into the project increases in expectation to finish a successful project.

## Symptoms and Consequences

-	Spending more money and time on a project that hasn’t success.
-	Organization ignores other opportunities. 

## Causes

-	Past problems were solved with time and money.
-	The manager is afraid of damaging is image

## Solution

-	Change of managers.
-	Creation of milestones.

## Notes

This anti-pattern is very similar to “Vietnam War” that’s why they have the same sources. There are two documents because the explanation of one isn’t the explanation of the other.
