# Lone-Wolf

## Also Known As

n/a

## Summary

Lone-Wolf is an anti-pattern in which an individual deliberately or implicitly disregards team decisions, plans, and communication. The person operates independently, contributing in isolation rather than as part of a coordinated team. While individual productivity may appear high, the overall effect is negative, leading to duplication of work, misalignment with project goals, and reduced team effectiveness.

## Context

This anti-pattern commonly appears in teams that lack strong coordination mechanisms or clear communication practices. It is often tolerated when the individual is perceived as highly skilled or productive.

## Unbalanced Forces

-	Desire for autonomy and individual control.
-	Weak enforcement of team processes and agreements.
-	Tolerance of individual exceptions for perceived high performers.
-	Lack of transparency in planning and prioritization.
-	Insufficient feedback or accountability mechanisms.

## Symptoms and Consequences

-	Passive participation in team communication channels.
-	Work performed without regard to current priorities or plans.
-	Tasks are completed out of order or far ahead of schedule.
-	Duplication of work already done or assigned to others.
-	Limited awareness of project status and ongoing activities.
-	Integration problems due to misaligned changes.
-	Decreased overall productivity despite individual effort.

## Causes

-	Strong individualistic mindset.
-	Lack of buy-in to team goals or processes.
-	Poor communication culture.
-	Inadequate onboarding or role clarification.
-	Organizational tolerance of siloed behavior.

## (Refactored) Solution

Reinforce shared ownership, transparency, and collaboration. Clearly communicate priorities and expectations, and ensure that all work is visible and aligned with team plans. Encourage active participation in communication and decision-making. Address Lone-Wolf behavior early through feedback, coaching, and, if necessary, process enforcement.

## Variations (optional) 

-	Brilliant Lone-Wolf: Individual produces high-quality work but ignores coordination.
-	Silent Lone-Wolf: Minimal communication combined with isolated contributions.
-	Remote Lone-Wolf: Physical or organizational distance amplifies isolation.

## Example(s) (optional) 

A developer implements features independently without consulting the backlog or informing the team, resulting in duplicated functionality and integration conflicts.

## Notes (optional)

Lone-Wolf behavior may initially appear beneficial but typically becomes harmful as project complexity increases.
