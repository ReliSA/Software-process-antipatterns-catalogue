# Waterfall

## Also Known As

n/a

## Summary

It’s the concept that we need to finish one step of the project to begin another

## Context

Involves linear progression, so a project it’ll be develop with phases: requirements, design, implementation, testing… Each phase is developed until the end to other start.

## Symptoms and Consequences

-	The model is simple to understand and to implement.
-	It’s a clear model, and we can see progress.
-	Probably will cause delays, because it is inflexible.
-	Testing phase only starts at the end of the project, so it led to being a big risk to the project.
-	It leads to limited client involvement. 

## Causes

-	Small and predictable projects with clear deliverables.

## Solution

-	A model that we can run phases of the project at the same time shows us less risk in relation to time (delays) and failures in general but it’s more complex to manage.
-	Regular revisions to what is being developed will help mitigate risks.


## Notes

It’s useable with small teams, big ones aren’t good for this model
