# Band Aid

**Also Known As:** The Quick Fix, Cosmetic Surgery


## Summary

The Band Aid anti-pattern occurs when a deep-rooted problem in a company or project is addressed with a superficial, quick, and painless workaround rather than a structural solution. The primary goal is often to create the appearance of progress or success—frequently to satisfy upper management—while leaving the underlying issues unresolved. Although the project may temporarily seem improved, the fundamental problems persist and typically resurface in more severe forms


## Symptoms

- Repeated application of short-term fixes to the same or similar problems.
- Emphasis on visible improvements rather than long-term effectiveness.
- Technical or process debt accumulates over time.
- Root cause analysis is skipped or discouraged.
- Problems reappear shortly after being “fixed”.
- Decisions prioritize managerial perception over project sustainability.
