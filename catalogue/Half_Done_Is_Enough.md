# Half Done Is Enough

## Also Known As

Untested but Finished

## Summary
Project activities overly focused on "visible" progress by management decision, i.e. effort is predominantly spent on adding functionality, with testing/QA and maintenance diminished or ignored. Major enhancements or changes are required to an existing deployed system due to accrued high level of technical debt.

## Context

## Symptoms and Consequences

## Symptoms
 - small proportion of activities other than pure implementation (testing, maintenance, refactoring, proper analysis and design)
 - rising technical debt, lack of modularity or reuse-ability, architectural erosion
 - project gradually slipping - decreasing rate of added features, increasing bug rate, postponing deadlines
 - prolonged periods of bugfixing and other maintenance
