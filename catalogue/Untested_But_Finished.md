# Untested But Finished

## Summary
The development is hardly finished in time. This is deemed to be caused by the lack of programers or their skills. Managers need to demonstrate big progress. When consequently outsiders are hired to make up for the slack, a lot of code of unknown quality is imported but big progress is demonstrated.

## Symptoms
 - too few programmers (optional)
 - low ratio of testing artifacts
 - deployment with lack of testing (optional)
 - suddenly increasing number of implementation tasks
 - lots of deployments or coding artifact added at the same time, followed by bug reports
