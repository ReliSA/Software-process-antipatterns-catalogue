# Architects Play Golf

## Summary
Sytem architects do not participate in the project after the architecture phase is done and expect strict compliance of development with the design.
This may be caused by outsourcing design or development to different company.

## Symptoms
 - architecture and implementation are in competence of different companies (optional)
 - people with the architect role do not interact with coding tasks (tickets)
 - architects do not generate or modify any source code, testing, deployment artifacts
 - architects only interact with non-coding people, tasks (tickets) and artifacts
 - since the architecture is done, architects do not participate in the project
