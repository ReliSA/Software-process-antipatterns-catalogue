# Blowhard Jamboree

## Also Known As

n/a

## Summary

A collection of ex-developers who are now managers congregate in a room and decide how the system should be implemented.  These so called industry experts, now informed mainly by second-hand reports from popular media, are often misinformed and/or represent prejudiced information. Rarely is there any hands-on research and experience backing up their conclusions.

## Context

## Unbalanced Forces

## Symptoms and Consequences

-	Architectural or implementation decisions are made without active developers’ involvement.
-	Decisions are justified by authority, seniority, or past experience rather than evidence.
-	Heavy reliance on buzzwords, trends, or popular industry narratives.
-	Little or no prototyping, experimentation, or proof-of-concept work.
-	Feedback from development teams is dismissed or ignored.
-	Resulting solutions are difficult to implement or fail to meet real project constraints.
