# Fungible Teams

## Also Known As

n/a

## Summary

Fungible Teams is an anti-pattern based on the assumption that team members—or even entire teams—can be freely swapped between projects without negative impact. This view treats people and teams as interchangeable resources, ignoring domain knowledge, social dynamics, and shared context. In practice, such substitutions disrupt collaboration, reduce quality, and negatively affect schedule and scope across all involved projects.

## Context

## Unbalanced Forces

## Symptoms and Consequences

-	Teams or individuals are reassigned between projects based solely on role or perceived expertise.
-	Knowledge and context are lost during frequent team changes.
-	Both the source and target projects experience declines in quality or productivity.
-	Schedules slip due to ramp-up time and reduced coordination.
-	When individuals are swapped, established team communication and trust are damaged.
-	Team cohesion deteriorates over time.
