# Cryptocracy

**Also Known As:**

n/a


## Summary

Cryptocracy is an anti-pattern in which an organizational hierarchy formally exists and is generally acknowledged, but its actual structure, authority, and decision-making paths are unclear or opaque. Team members do not know who is responsible for what, how decisions are made, or whom to approach for guidance. Although organizational charts may exist, they fail to reflect reality, resulting in confusion, inefficiency, and weakened accountability.


## Symptoms

•	The declared organizational structure does not manifest in day-to-day work.
•	Organizational charts change frequently or contradict observed behavior.
•	Decision-making authority is unclear or inconsistent.
•	Communication paths are ambiguous or bypassed.
•	Responsibilities overlap or are neglected.
•	Issues are escalated informally rather than through defined channels.
